## Description
NetPractice is a networking training project from the 42 curriculum designed to teach
the fundamentals of computer networking through practical exercises. The project consists
of multiple interactive levels where the user must configure networks to ensure proper
communication between hosts.

The main objective of NetPractice is to develop a solid understanding of how networks
operate, focusing on addressing, routing, and protocol layers.

## Instructions

### Running the training interface
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Select a level and read the objective carefully.
3. Configure the network elements (hosts, routers, interfaces) to achieve connectivity.

### Exporting configurations
- After successfully completing a level, export the configuration using the export button.
- Each level generates one configuration file.

### Submission requirements
- The submission must include **10 exported configuration files**.
- There must be **one exported configuration file per level**.
- All 10 files must be placed **at the root of the repository**.

## Resources

### Networking concepts studied
- TCP/IP addressing
- Subnet masks and CIDR notation
- Default gateway
- Routers and switches
- OSI model layers
- Basic routing principles

### References
- TCP/IP networking documentation
- OSI Model reference materials
- Subnetting tutorials and exercises
- General networking fundamentals guides

### Use of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence was used to:
- Assist in understanding networking theory and concepts
- Clarify documentation and terminology
- Improve the clarity and structure of this README

AI was not used to solve NetPractice levels or to generate exported configuration files.
